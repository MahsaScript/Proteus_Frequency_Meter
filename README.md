Proteus_Frequency_Meter
There is a frequency meter in the virtual instruments rack - this is designed to work with digital signals, but it's easy enough to arrange for a waveform to be converted from analogue to digital using a compare or A->D primitive. Alternatively you could graph the output and measure the time for a complete cycle.
